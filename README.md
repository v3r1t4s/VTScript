# WELCOME to WinUnderIR

This project is intend to be a toolkit for an Incident Responder or any type of blue team operator too!

As of this day (3/8/2023), you'll find:
- VTScript
- WinEventParser

## VTScript

First tool, that let you search search files hashes, URLs, domains and IPs!

You'll need to add your api key (from the VirusTotal API) in a file somewhere on your system (best option will be to put it in `VTSript` folder) but it's as you want! You'll just need to do this simple thing to properly run the tool!

## WinEventParser

Second tool, that let you search for malicious activity through the Windows Event Log system !

(The only requirement is to have this repo and of course a windows machine to search for logs!)
